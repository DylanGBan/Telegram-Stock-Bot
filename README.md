## Description
Created a stock bot that tracks and gives recent news articles about stocks that are chosen by the user. 
Deployed through Telegram with the use of a Telegram bot, stock bot will record and document stocks that are added by the user. 
These stocks are sorted using SQLite3. The most recent news about the stocks inside of the user's profile is gathered using yFinance. 
Daily morning digests are sent to the user, including an AI powered summary using OpenAI's API.
